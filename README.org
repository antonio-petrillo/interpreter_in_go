#+title: Write an interpreter in go

* DONE Chapter 1 - Lexing
Build a lexer, so far so good.
What seemed to be really complex now is clear and simple.
Now I feel confident writing a lexer, actually I will say more, I can do a better job (in some specific case) than the code in the book.
* DONE Chapter 2 - Parsing
Parserize the token obtained from previous step.
On some parts I need to study a little bit further, but overall I'm ok.
The techinique used to parse the precedence in the parsing is really nice.
Now I also understand why the parsing for lisp is trivial.
